This bot creation was originally supposed to assist a discord server. 

However, the server is now disbanded therefore I've made this repository public.

# Self-Hosting
I personally do not support self-hosting as any errors you make is your responsibility. Newbie developers can use this source code to have a look at it and how it functions.

# Support
If you have any questions you can contact me via adding me through discord. My username and discriminator is **Ivanio#7978**

The link for my discord server (hangout) is https://discord.gg/BatwkX5NbG
